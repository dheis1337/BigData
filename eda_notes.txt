Flights EDA notes

Basic counts:
US Air, United, Southwest, American, Delta make up 30% of all flights.

Flights across year is approx symmetric

Flights across month is approxsymmetric

Flights across day of week is approx symmetric

Flights across day of month is approx symmetric

Flights per origin airport is skewed towards bigger airports; as expected

Roughly 39% of flights are delayed in some capacity

Roughly 19% of flights have no delay at all

Roughly 39% of flights depart early

Roughly 30% of flights had both DEP and ARR delay

Roughly 75% of flights with arrival delays had departure delays



Mean delay time by carrier is approx symmetric; especially among top 5 airlines; delta is lowest

Flights tend to be delayed more frequently as the day goes on



Distributions of variables
DEP_DELAY is extremely right-skewed

ARR_DELAY is extremely right skewed

AIR_TIME is right-skewed 

DISTANCE is right-skewed

CRS_DEP_TIME is symmetric

CRS_ELAPSED_TIME is right-skewed


Possible predictors
DEP_DELAY, DISTANCE_GROUP, DISTANCE, CRS_ELAPSED_TIME, CRS_DEP_TIME, ORIGIN, DEST,
UNIQUE_CARRIER, 


Predictor imputation needed
DEP_DELAY CRS_ELAPSED_TIME
