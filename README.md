### Overview
This is a repository dedicated to big data projects I'm working. Currently, I have
a machine learning project using the popular [Airline On-Time](https://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets/) dataset. In this project, I use R and Apache Spark (using `sparklyr`) to build, 
evaluate, and compare a few different machine learning models to predict the 
delay in arrival times for flights. For a more in-depth report on this project,
